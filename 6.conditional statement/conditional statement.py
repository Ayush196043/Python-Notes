# If... Else in One Line.

#:-There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used 
#when the condition being is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short.
#Hear's an example:
#Example:-
a=330
b=3303
print("A") if a>b else print("=") if a==b else print("B")

print(9) if a<b else "" # else "" kea use kare ge last me.
